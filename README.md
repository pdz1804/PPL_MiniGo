# MiniGo 

This repository is a complete implementation of the **MiniGo compiler**, built across four course assignments as part of the **CO3005 ‚Äì Principles of Programming Languages** course at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology.

---

## üìò Overview

**MiniGo** is a simplified subset of the Go programming language tailored for compiler construction education. It retains essential features‚Äîlike basic types, control structures, structs, and interfaces‚Äîwhile removing complex ones like goroutines and the full standard library.

The goal is to provide students with a manageable yet real-world language for implementing all key compiler phases: **Lexical Analysis**, **Syntax Parsing**, **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation**, **Static Semantic Checking**, and **Code Generation**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

MiniGo supports a rich set of language features, including:

### ‚úÖ Type System
- **Primitive Types**: `int`, `float`, `boolean`, `string`
- **Composite Types**: `array`, `struct`, `interface`
- **Type inference** and type-safe assignments

### ‚úÖ Control Structures
- `if`, `else if`, `else` statements
- `for` loops:
  - Simple condition loop
  - C-style loop with initialization and update
  - `for-range` loop over arrays

### ‚úÖ Functions & Methods
- Supports multiple parameters and optional return values
- Receiver-based methods for `struct` types
- Methods support interface-based polymorphism

### ‚úÖ Expressions & Operators
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Relational: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `:=` (declaration+assignment)
- Struct and array indexing via `.` and `[]`

### ‚úÖ Statements
- Variable and constant declarations (with and without type)
- Assignment, call, return, break, continue statements

### ‚úÖ Built-in Functions
```go
getInt(), putInt(), putIntLn()
getFloat(), putFloat(), putFloatLn()
getBool(), putBool(), putBoolLn()
getString(), putString(), putStringLn()
putLn()
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

> Make sure Python 3.12+ and Java (with Jasmin if running Assignment 4) are installed.

1. **Change to the appropriate source directory** for the assignment:
   ```bash
   cd BTL1_2_NHP/src    # or BTL3_NHP/src or BTL4_NHP/src
   ```

2. **Generate parser and lexer (for first-time setup):**
   ```bash
   python run.py gen
   ```

3. **Run test suites for each phase:**
   ```bash
   python run.py test LexerSuite         # Assignment 1 - Lexer
   python run.py test ParserSuite        # Assignment 1 - Parser
   python run.py test ASTGenSuite        # Assignment 2 - AST Generation
   python run.py test CheckSuite         # Assignment 3 - Static Checker
   python run.py test CodeGenSuite       # Assignment 4 - JVM Code Generation
   ```

4. **(Assignment 4 only)** Compile and run the Jasmin output on JVM:
   ```bash
   java -jar lib/jasmin.jar MiniGoClass.j
   java MiniGoClass
   ```

- Token set (keywords, operators, separators, literals)
- Expression and statement grammar
- Scoping rules and typing
- Built-in functions and method resolution
